# Proma

> **[Fork notice]** This repository is an enhanced fork of [proma-ai/Proma](https://github.com/proma-ai/Proma) and has used its **own version line since v1.0.0** (independent from upstream versioning; the upstream base of each release is documented in its release notes and the [Fork Maintenance Guide](./docs/fork-maintenance.md)). Key differences from upstream:
>
> - **QuickAsk floating panel**: an isolated short-conversation popup inside Chat / Agent with its own model and reasoning-level selection, never touching the host session's context;
> - **Custom-channel reasoning levels**: self-hosted OpenAI-compatible channels can declare reasoning levels mapped to `reasoning_effort`, switchable directly in the Chat / Agent toolbar (upstream only offers thinking depth for built-in models);
> - **Feishu cards show the channel name**: with the same model on multiple channels, the actual channel is now visible on the card footer;
> - **Rendering fix**: untagged code blocks no longer misclassify path lists as programming languages;
> - **Managed ngrok and multi-project MCP**: isolated configuration and credentials, verified Endpoint reuse, dynamic project permissions, and Agent queues; see the [v1.12.1 release notes](./release-notes/v1.12.1.md);
> - **Stable packaging**: pinned hoisted install layout plus an Electron binary self-check in the one-command build script (`scripts/build-win.ps1`).
>
> Sync policy: upstream is merged regularly (`bun run sync:upstream`); the full diff inventory and conflict notes live in [docs/fork-maintenance.md](./docs/fork-maintenance.md).

## About Proma

Proma is an open-source, general-purpose desktop Agent product built for professional users. It covers the capabilities expected from leading Agent products, including:

- Chat mode
- Agent mode
- Plan mode
- Project isolation
- Memory
- An in-app browser
- An in-app terminal
- Scheduled tasks
- Parallel Agent exploration
- Child sessions and parent sessions
- Skills / MCP / CLI
- Remote connectivity: WeChat, Feishu, DingTalk, and Slack
- Previewing and editing for many file types

### Built for professional workflows

Proma adds focused capabilities for professional workflows so Agents can operate more smoothly in demanding scenarios. Every capability below is integrated with Agents and designed to work together naturally:

- **Todo**: capture unfinished work and later reference it directly from the input box to continue. You can also work with an Agent to create Todos for everyday reminders, and sync them with macOS Reminders.
- **Calendar**: let Agents create and manage your calendar, avoid conflicts around important events, and collaborate on scheduling. Calendar data can also sync with macOS Calendar.
- **Obsidian**: deeply integrate Obsidian with a more capable real-time Markdown editing experience, giving knowledge-management, knowledge-creation, and research users a fluid way to work with Agents.
- **In-app terminal and browser**: give Agents a visible terminal and browser they can sign in to and use directly, making programming and automation workflows smoother.
- **Agent exploration**: professional work often benefits from diverse, parallel exploration. Rather than polluting the current context, Proma lets you explore other possibilities fully and bring the useful findings back when needed.
- **Child sessions and parent sessions**: similar to SubAgents, but with cleaner context, persistent session-level deliverables, and room for iterative work. Parent and child sessions enable parallel Agent processing, deep research, adversarial analysis, continuous repairs in a parent session, and ongoing reviews in child sessions—ultimately creating better context for better outcomes.
- **Automatic worktree workflows**: developers can quickly work through Git worktrees in Proma. The Agent proactively selects the relevant worktree in the right panel, shows the diff against `main`, and lets you enter a visible Proma terminal with one click.

## Proma's Core Capabilities and Design Philosophy

Proma is one of the few Agent products built specifically for professional users. For heavy Agent users in particular, it offers more transparent Agent execution, more visible configuration, better separation of projects, memory, and Skills, a simpler and more coherent preview-and-editing experience, and rich built-in capabilities such as a browser and terminal.

Proma completely rethinks the interaction and UX system. The left side manages conversations and provides access to primary features. The middle is the main Agent-output area, where you and the Agent interact. The right side is the supporting workspace: project files, Agent file changes, document previews, child-session interactions, the in-app browser, terminal, Obsidian, calendar, Todos, Skills, and more—all there to help the Agent in the middle produce better results.

For today's Agents and large language models, better intelligence starts with better context. Our central work is helping you organize that context. The capabilities below explain both this principle and how Proma is designed from a professional user's perspective to create better context.

## Feature Highlights

### Child Sessions and Parent Sessions

The left side shows the parent session. When you need to conduct deep research in parallel, increase efficiency and information density, or perform adversarial checks, child sessions are a better choice. You can even view parent and child sessions side by side. Compared with traditional SubAgents, child sessions have cleaner context, a persistent and interactive environment for iterative work, more freedom in model selection, and better performance.

![Proma child and parent sessions](https://img.erlich.fun/personal-blog/proma/image-20260908112300711.png)

### Exploration Mode

This is exploration, not merely branching. After an Agent finishes responding, click **Explore** to create as many parallel paths as you need while retaining the preceding context. Use them simultaneously for research or curiosity. When you finish, use the button in the upper-right corner of an exploration to bring its findings back to the parent session. This gives the main thread richer context without allowing uncertain decisions or edge cases to disrupt it prematurely.

![Proma exploration mode](https://img.erlich.fun/personal-blog/proma/image-20260908112614345.png)

### File Changes

Many products refer to all file operations performed by an Agent as Artifacts. At their core, though, they are file changes. Proma groups file changes by turn; it shows diffs for programming workflows; and in worktree-based development it proactively selects the relevant worktree and places a terminal button next to it. One click takes you into development, and the Agent can operate this workflow too.

![Proma file changes](https://img.erlich.fun/personal-blog/proma/image-20260908113333692.png)

### Skills / MCP / CLI

Proma supports all three. But the best Skills do not come from the internet or from someone else—they come from your real workflows. We recommend walking an Agent through a real process once, then having it turn that process into a Skill and iterating through real use. Proma includes several Skills we consider essential and supports one-click installation for common MCP servers and CLIs. The Commercial Edition also supports team-wide Skill sharing and iterative management.

Skills and MCP servers are scoped by project. Too many of them can reduce Agent effectiveness; keeping them per-project reduces unnecessary context and can naturally improve real-world results, though it does require more deliberate attention from the user.

### In-App Browser

Agents can actively use Proma's in-app browser. It is suited to browser automation, filling gaps left by web search, and research or cross-checking on automation-sensitive websites. For example, part of my own Xiaohongshu workflow is managed through Proma's in-app browser: replying in group chats and to comments, collecting feedback, and automatically recording it as Todos. Agents also use the browser frequently when you develop websites. It is a powerful capability whose full potential we are still exploring.

![Proma in-app browser](https://img.erlich.fun/personal-blog/proma/image-20260908113724838.png)

### Memory

Proma's memory is also separated by project. Every project can have its own `AGENTS.md`, which operates at the project level and guides Agent behavior across that project: the layout of project files, interaction rules, essential information, and conventions that must be followed.

For more specific memory, `MEMORY.md` serves as the index, with additional files organized by topic. If you have used Proma for a while but have not yet built these resources, open a new session and ask the Agent to create the current project's `AGENTS.md` and explore your recent two weeks or month of sessions to form memory about you and the project.

![Proma project memory](https://img.erlich.fun/personal-blog/proma/image-20260908114118777.png)

### File Preview and Editing

Proma supports previewing and editing common file types. For Markdown, we use a Live Markdown approach that gives you a simple, practical editing experience similar to Typora or Obsidian. Proma also previews PDFs, DOCX files, presentations, Excel files, and more. You can do more than preview: highlight parts of a document, discuss specific passages with the Agent across multiple turns, or open Q&A to get quick answers to simpler questions.

### Projects, Project Files, Session Files, and Sessions

For Proma, good context requires a clear separation between projects and project files. For a category of work, you may create different projects and add the files that project might need to its project directory. Or you can create a project in an existing folder and work with an Agent to build an `AGENTS.md` that guides that project.

A session is each individual conversation. Each session should focus on a specific, small task; splitting work into appropriate tasks remains a core responsibility for every Agent user. One-off reference files and material for the current task are best placed in the session folder—anything you drag into the input box goes there.

If you are concerned that a new session will not know what you are working on or need context from a prior session, build the habit of converting useful knowledge into the project's `AGENTS.md`, memory, Skills, and documents. You can also take the quick route: drag the prior session from the left sidebar into the input box to reference it, or type `&` to add a reference. When you want to reference a specific file already in the current project or session folder, you can drag it from the right panel and add a brief instruction—or use `@` if that is your preferred workflow.

### Scheduled Tasks

Agents can create and iteratively improve scheduled tasks for you. The more routine the work, the more likely it can become a scheduled task. Proma supports not only one-time runs and fixed intervals, but also complex schedules such as running every 20 minutes between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM on weekdays.

![Proma scheduled tasks](https://img.erlich.fun/personal-blog/proma/image-20260908112055273.png)

### Built-In Calendar and Todo

Agents can operate every calendar event and Todo, and you can edit them manually as well. Agents can help you record them, understand your schedule when appropriate, and plan your work around it. Voice input can be especially helpful for this, and Proma includes it too.

![Proma Todo](https://img.erlich.fun/personal-blog/proma/image-20260908111521550.png)

### Obsidian

We built an Obsidian-inspired Markdown editor to better organize your personal knowledge and the knowledge created by Agents. It also makes note-taking and writing convenient, while letting you manage and edit content in Obsidian as usual.
